Get Started with Salesforce Billing

Salesforce Billing helps imporve service delivery and payment experience for customers and
optimziing how Finance works with Sales and other teams 

Salesforce enabling you to help customers at each touchpoint - Marketing to Sales to Finance to Service and everywhere in between
is called Lead to Cash 

You first start with Sales Cloud - managing sales data, leads and opportunities then to configure, price and quote process with Salesforce CPQ
At the tail end is where you generate contracts and orders, setting up foundation for billing your customer and that's where Billing is 

Recurring Business/ Recurring Revenue
    Many traditional, siloed systems dont have the functiuonality to manage complexity that comes along with recurring business 
    such as how to treat the concept of time, contract amendments and proration so Billing helps with this 
True Cross Team Collaboration
    When using a single platform you can work more closely with teams that may have been siloed in the past 
    There's a whole process from selling to billing that need to be thought through befor executing

Consider the Revenue lifecycle which starts with Sales
Opportunity > Quote > Contract 
    Finance, Sales and Sales Operations being interdependent
    The efficiency of all these aspects is important to success of the business 

Order > Invoice > Payment

Manage the Billing process

Finance's Seat at the Table
It's Important to Understand that even though its used by Sales, Salesforce CPQ really is the first stop for the Finance team 

Contract gets generated, where the terms and commitments influence the way you recognize revenue 
Order then gets created which helps track bookings and generates the invoice 
Its important that these get done right so Billing can take this information 
and continue the process through invoice to accounts receivable

Opportunities provided through Billing
    True automation, data flows easily from quotes, contracts and orders into invoicing
    Sales to Finance gap is eliminated. Both teams can easily adapt since they are on the same platform working 

Time is on your Side 
    Salesforce Billing brings CPQ around full circle 
Benefits:
    Align Billing dates across Amendments 
    Override Billing Dates 
    Hold Billing 
    Proration 

Since Salesforce CPQ manages the subscription and amendments, you can see the exact amount that will be billed early 
in the quoting process for both new orders and orders generated from contract amendments.

Give Finance a Helping Hand 

If you deliver on an experience that works, odds are you've just converted a customer in an advocate
Billing helps to make things easier especially in the face of change 

Invoice Exectuion 
    One time invoicing - ability to manually post invoices
    Recurring invoicing - ability to automate invoices that meet a specific criteria. Ideal for common, transactional interactions
    Variable Invoicing/ Dynamic Invoice Plan - for non-standard billing frequencies, such as billing to milestones or project acceptance

Streamlined Order to Invoice Conversion
    When Sales and Finance are separated, you can run the risk of inaccuracy and confused processes 
    If you attempt to introduce it through recurring business, the process breaks down 
    With Salesforce CPQ and Billing, end to end customer engagment can be managed in Salesforce in the ERP
