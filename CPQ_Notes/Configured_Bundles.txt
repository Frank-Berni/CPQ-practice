Features are a way of group similar options 
    When you edit related Features on a product you can create a new record for it 
    Afterwards you can assign that Feature to any relevant Options under the Feature field
    Then when you open the configurator, the QLE will separate each Feature accordiningly, 
    any unnamed features are named Other 

Max Options in the QLE show radio buttons instead of checkboxes
The AdditionalInstructions as a text (long) field can be added that puts text below the feature name, 
helps with guiding sales reps

Feature Categories can also help organize features, which have their own tabs
    Under the values picklist you can add more options to choose from

Configuration Field Set
    Set up under Product Option > Field Sets > New 
    Once you create the Field Set Label and Name, you can drag the fields you want included in the set 
    Under Product Feature > Fields & Relationships > Configuration Field Set > add that Field Set created to the picklist 
    Then you click the Product you want > Related Tab > Click on a Feature > Set Configuration Field Set to the one you created 

Configured Code - helps with automating the catalog process
    You can add Component Codes under a related product's options such as -P22
    Component Code Position acts an index for it 
    Under the main Product you can enter the Configured Code Pattern to control how they are shown, ex: LAP{1}{2}{3}
    In the QLE, you can see these changes under the blue arrow, on the right
