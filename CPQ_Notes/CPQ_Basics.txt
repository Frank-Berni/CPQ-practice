Starting point for all prices is the standard Price Book and this can be expanded on when you have multiple price books
You can also use different pricing methods on a product by product basis
Cost Plus Markup pricing method can be used when unit costs are set for a product
Block Price method can be used to lock a specific price if a quantity falls in a certain range

CPQ offers tiered discounts for volume based prices
Sales team can manually enter discounts line by line

Manage Contracts and Renewals

When there are subscription based products or services, these have start and end dates.
Toward the end a Closed Won quote and Opportunity result in a contract for the duration of those subscription

The contracted field triggers the contract and renewal cycle which can be automated when an Opp is marked as Closed/Won
Whenever a contract is amended, CPQ creates a new quote and opportunity 
which prices according to how much time is left on the contract

CPQ can automatically create renewal opportunities and quotes for subscription products before it ends
The renewal can also automate when its ready for a final quote
