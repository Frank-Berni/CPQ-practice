Get Started with Salesforce CPQ

CPQ = Configure Price Quote

CPQ helps build efficiency when closing deals

Configure - pick out what they'll buy
Price - we add it up
Quote - generates a PDF

Configure
    Uses smart rules to make sure you and your reps sell related products together 
    prevents incompatible products ending up on the same Quote

Price
    Can apply discounts and Salesforce handles the rest
    Kind of like a built in case register

Quote 
    automatically generates a quote for you with e-signature integration
